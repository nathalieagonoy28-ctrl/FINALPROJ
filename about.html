        <h1>ABOUT THE TEAM</h1>
        <p>
          The core team behind Crusina’s Handicrafts is led by myself, Juvelyn Pacete Crusina, as the owner and artisan. I am responsible for the entire creative process, from designing the bags to handcrafting each piece using coconut shells, Ilocos Abel fabric, and other materials. My role also involves overseeing production, ensuring quality control, and managing day-to-day operations. As the visionary behind the business, I make sure that every product aligns with our commitment to sustainability and Filipino craftsmanship. And also, My family plays an important role as my support system. They are always there when I feel hopeless or exhausted, offering encouragement and motivation during challenging times. Their emotional support gives me the strength to keep going forward in the face of failures. They help to make the journey easier by lending support, offering guidance, or just being there to listen. Knowing that I am not alone in this journey, this constant encouragement enables me to concentrate on the creative and operational aspects of the business. And In the future, as the business grows, I plan to bring in additional artisans to help with production and expand the brand’s reach. With a dedicated team that shares the same vision and passion, we aim to create a sustainable and successful business built on craftsmanship and environmental responsibility.
